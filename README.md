This repository contains the codes used to conduct the study *"Kuroshio Extension and Gulf Stream dominate the Eddy Kinetic Energy intensification observed in the global ocean"*  by  **BarcelÃ³-Llull, B., RosellÃ³, P., Combes, V., SÃ¡nchez-RomÃ¡n, A., Pujol, M. I., & Pascual, A.**  Published in **Scientific Reports** (2025) ðŸ”— [DOI: 10.1038/s41598-025-06149-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-06149-9)

This repository is built from the repository of Pere RossellÃ³ available at: https://github.com/pererossello/EKE_all_two_sat

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- `code/`: Contains the Python code used for data retrieval, pre-processing, and figure generation.
    - `download_data/`: Jupyter notebooks for downloading the raw data.
    - `preprocessing/`: Jupyter notebooks for each step of the data preprocessing.
    - `generate_figures/`: Jupyter notebooks for generating each figure in the manuscript.  
    - `utils.py`: Utility functions used throughout the project.
    - `data_retrieve_utils.py`: Functions used for data retrieval.
    - `preprocessing_utils.py`: Preprocessing functions.
    - `plot_utils.py`: Functions used for plotting the results.
    
    
- `results/`: Contains the results of the computations done in the `preprocessing/` directory, including netCDF files with EKE time series.
- `figures/`: Contains the figures generated by the code.
- `tables/`: Contains the table generated by the code.

## Getting Started
Instructions for downloading the data and executing the computations can be found in the Jupyter notebooks in the `download_data/` and `preprocessing/` directories, respectively. 

However, if you only wish to evaluate the EKE time series and/or generate figures, you can directly run the Jupyter notebooks in the `generate_figures/` directory with the preprocessed data provided in `results/`.
